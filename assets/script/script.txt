// Chapter 1 Game intro slides
1.In one of the small nooks on the maps of our world lied a town full of characters and adventures.
1.The town was called Spiritstead and those who stumbled into its ravines and grass fields often ended up there without intending to.
1.The  mountains made good work of keeping the town hidden from the dangers beyond the valley.  Few could ever intentionally find their way there.
1.Though direction was a hard thing to come by in this world, if you stumbled into Spiritstead it was certainly because you were lost.
1.Frank was no exception
2.Frank was a young farmer. He aspired to be the greatest farmer in all of the maps!
2.However, he did not have a farm and he had been looking for work as farmer for quite some time.
3. Although he couldâ€™ve sworn his map directed him to a large city full of buildings, moving parts and most importantly farms, he found himself wandering through a forest path and greeted by something entirely different.
4. What lay before him was a small village nestled at the feet of mountains.
4.The opening of the forest had been only an hour behind him, but he did not recall mountains being nearby.
4.Where was he?
4. How had he ended up there?
5.Among the scenery his eyes found an unkept FARM!
5.With hungry eyes, he made him way towards the town.
