// Chapter 1 Game intro slides
1.In one of the small nooks of our world lies a town full of peculiar characters and fantastic adventures.
1.This little town was called Spiritstead. Those who stumbled into its lush ravines and flowing fields often ended up there without intending.
1.The mountains shrouded the hidden town from eyes beyond the valley. Few ever intentionally found their way there.
1.Though direction can be a hard thing to discover in this world, if you stumbled into Spiritstead it was certainly because you were lost.
1.Simran was no exception.
2.Simran is a young farmer. He aspired to be the greatest farmer in the entire world!
2.However, he did not have a farm although he had been looking for one for quite some time.
3.Simran couldâ€™ve sworn his map had directed him to a large city with plenty of farms nearby, but he instead found himself wandering through a forested path, encountering something entirely different.
4.What lay before him was a small village nestled at the foot of a mountain.
4.The opening of the forest had been only an hour behind him, and he did not recall mountains being nearby.
4.Where was he?
4.How had he ended up here?
5.Among the scenery his eyes found an unkept FARM!
5.With hungry eyes, he made him way towards the town.
